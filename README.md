A Gopher client in Python, without the use of any external gopher-related libraries. The client ‘crawls’ a specified server, does some simple analysis and reporting of what resources are there, as well as detects, reports and deals with any issues with the server or its content. The code opens sockets in the standard socket() API way, makes appropriate and correctly-formed gopher requests on its own, and captures / interprets the results.
